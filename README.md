# Address-Embedding


This repository contains a script designed to find similar rows based on names or addresses between two files. It is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to match entities, such as customers or vendors, using partial or ambiguous information like names or addresses. By leveraging text similarity techniques, the script efficiently identifies and highlights matching rows across the two datasets.



The implementation utilizes **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** embedding to calculate similarity between rows. This approach enables robust matching even when the input data contains slight variations or inconsistencies. This tool is ideal for reconciling datasets in tasks like customer deduplication, vendor matching, or address resolution.
